*** cosine vs euclidean

while looking for test data, I came across this article:
[[https://cmry.github.io/notes/euclidean-v-cosine][Euclidean vs. Cosine Distance]]

it has some data but also an explanation about the topic. Or, at
least, about an interesting difference between cosine and Euclidean:

#+begin_quote
While cosine looks at the angle between vectors (thus not taking into
regard their weight or magnitude), euclidean distance is similar to
using a ruler to actually measure the distance. In our example the
angle between x14 and x4 was larger than those of the other vectors,
even though they were further away.

*** clip to pinecone

maybe the way how I transform tensor to embeds is wrong?
this artical from pinecone should show how to transfrom model results
into vector db suitable vectors properly:

CLOSED: [2023-11-20 Mon 13:08]

After I've spent some time with trying to fight with global mutex and
safe / borrowing rules of rust, it feels that it becomes more and more
cumbersome.

The reason is that I can't simply return a pointer to collection or
points, just because rust thinks that it is not safe. And it makes
sense.

So I was thinking, maybe it makes sense to revise the API so that all
the interact with DB by, first, opening db, returning an "object" and
then interacting with this db via this object.

Need to figure how to do it Rust / WASM

#+begin_src js
  let db = twellik.open("my-coll")
  // db.create_collection("my-coll")
  db.upsert_points("my-coll", points)
  let result = db.scroll_points("my-coll", { vector: [1, 2], k: 10, payload: { foo: 45}})

*** Object stores in indexeddb can be only created in =onupgradeneeded=

from [[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API/Using_IndexedDB#creating_and_structuring_the_store][Using IndexedDB: Creating and structuring the store]]:

#+begin_quote
As indicated previously, onupgradeneeded is the only place where you
can alter the structure of the database. In it, you can create and
delete object stores and build and remove indices.
#+end_quote

Another words, stores are sort of tables in traditional databases.
Therefore, I will probably stick to "db -> index binary" shape and
keep them all in one, global object store

IndexDB has a binary storage, which might be an advantage. From the
other hand, it doesn't make sense to create overhead for db by using
another db.. storage should be simple and portable, this way it would
be easier to port Twellek from browser to WASI and other runtimes.

=Blob= is not supported on Safari it seems:

#+begin_quote
Not everything can be stored in IndexedDB on all platforms

If you are storing large, user-generated files such as images or
videos, then you may try to store them as File or Blob objects. This
will work on some platforms but fail on others. Safari on iOS, in
particular, cannot store Blobs in IndexedDB.

Luckily it is not too difficult to convert a Blob into an ArrayBuffer,
and vice versa. Storing ArrayBuffers in IndexedDB is very well
supported.

#+begin_quote
All asynchronous operations immediately return an IDBRequest
instance. Each request has a readyState that is set to the 'pending'
state; this changes to 'done' when the request is completed or
fails. When the state is set to done, every request returns a result
and an error, and an event is fired on the request. When the state is
still pending, any attempt to access the result or error raises an
InvalidStateError exception.

* CANCELLED [?] Consider js/ts wrapper
CLOSED: [2023-11-20 Mon 16:08]
After I've spent some time with web_sys and indexed_db, I found it
pretty hard to make a wrappre for indexed db inside of WASM.

The idea was to convert indexed_db =open= to future which waits for
=readyState= of indexed_db -- to make it a little bit more elegant.

It seems I see the light in the end of this rabbit hole, however, it
feels too tricky for a simple db_open operation.

Mabe I should better make a small wrapper which opens db in JS and
passes it into WASM after? So that Rust assumes that it is ready and
successfully opened, to avoid all this hustle.

There is a minimal cost to communicate with the GPU device (about 300
ms in the experimentation and only occur on the first GPU call). You
need to have a great amount of data to use the GPU. Otherwise, it's
slower than the single thread version. The communication cost with GPU
is negligible when using large arrays. If the array is too large, we
got an exception. (Maybe it's time to do batch processing and do
multiple GPU call.)

The Advanced Vector Extensions of modern CPU can be used per
thread. Adding more threads reduce the computation time. Compared to
the simple method, it uses about half (or less) the time to do the
same job in the integer version. If the dataset is a double array, the
performance is the same or worst.

Obviously, using double is way slower than integer. If possible,
always prefer integer. If you want to keep some digits, you could
multiple the number by 10 or 100 and convert it to integer. If you
really want to keep double, maybe you should consider using the GPU.

If we compare the vectorized version (integer array, v1 and v2), the
dot product is faster than doing an addition/multiplication on an
accumulator vector and taking the sum of the accumulator when having
small dimension in the array. (It's slower than the simple method on 1
thread.) But, if you consider an array with a lot of dimension, it's
faster using an accumulator vector than using the dot product
operation.
